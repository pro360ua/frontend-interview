# Candidate

### Task Overview

**Objective**: Enhance the existing React SPA by integrating with the `/api/users` endpoint, implementing user-detail views, adding search functionality, and applying CSS for an improved UI.

### Task 1: Fetch and Display User List (15 minutes)

- **Description**: Fetch a list of users from the `/api/users` endpoint and display them on the `/users` route/page in the React app.

### Task 2: Individual User Detail View (15 minutes)
